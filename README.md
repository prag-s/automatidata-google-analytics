<H2># automatidata (  A Google Analytics Project) </H2>
New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) required to build a model to predict Taxi gratituties trends of their customers.  

 The goal of the project is to predict high rider gratituty using 
     <ul><li> multiple regression 
     <li> random forest </ul>

<h3>Business Understanding</h3>
According to Salary.com, a taxi driver in New York City make $46,000 today. But in 2017, it was around $28,000. This salary is significantly low. Hence, it is important for taxi drivers to understand the factors leading to high gratituties as that will help riders to obtain a livable wage.


<h3>What we achieved here : </h3>
We have a Random forest model and XGBoost model for the dataset. 
Although our models are not with great results, its objective of gratituties relationship with the dataset is established. 


<h3>What is next `todo` for TLC: </h3>
<ul><li> TLC website : <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page>LINK</a> has many more newer dataset availble. I can use these dataset to re-run on my models.
